    "passage": "The meteorological phenomenon known as 'El Niño' can significantly impact global weather patterns. During an El Niño event, the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean experiences unusually warm ocean temperatures, which can lead to severe weather changes worldwide, such as increased rainfall in some areas and droughts in others.",
    "question": "What is the primary effect of an El Niño event on global weather patterns?",
    "options": [
      "It causes uniform weather changes across the globe.",
      "It leads to cooler ocean temperatures in the Pacific.",
      "It results in increased rainfall in all regions.",
      "It disrupts global weather patterns by altering ocean temperatures."

    "passage": "Quantum entanglement is a physical phenomenon that occurs when pairs or groups of particles interact in such a way that the quantum state of each particle cannot be described independently of the state of the others. This phenomenon challenges our classical understanding of particle behavior and has implications for quantum computing and cryptography.",
    "question": "How does quantum entanglement challenge classical understanding of particle behavior?",
    "options": [
      "By allowing particles to act independently.",
      "By making particle behavior predictable.",
      "By linking the quantum states of particles in a way that defies classical descriptions.",
      "By simplifying the interactions between particles."

    "passage": "In classical economics, the concept of 'utility' refers to the satisfaction or pleasure derived from consuming goods and services. Economists often use utility to explain consumer choice and to model how individuals allocate their resources among various goods and services to maximize their overall satisfaction.",
    "question": "What role does the concept of 'utility' play in classical economics?",
    "options": [
      "It describes the amount of physical resources used in production.",
      "It helps explain how consumer choices are made to maximize satisfaction.",
      "It measures the overall cost of producing goods and services.",
      "It predicts changes in market prices based on supply and demand."

    "question": "What does the Pythagorean theorem describe?",
    "options": [
      "The area of a triangle.",
      "The relationship between the sides of a right-angled triangle.",
      "The sum of the interior angles of a triangle.",

    "passage": "The theory of relativity, developed by Albert Einstein, revolutionized the field of physics by introducing the concept that space and time are intertwined in a single continuum. This theory describes how objects in motion experience time and space differently compared to objects at rest.",
    "question": "What fundamental concept is introduced by Einstein's theory of relativity?",
    "options": [
      "The independence of space and time.",
      "The constant speed of light in a vacuum.",
